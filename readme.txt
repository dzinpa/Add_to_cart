 My first project:). Use JavaScript and jQuery only.
 
 The main task: add a product to the shopping cart.
 
 When you add a product, the state of the button changes, 
 you can increase or reduce the item count.
 
 In the cart you can delete the item.
 
 Also implemented a banner with a change of photos and text.
